    """Partially observable merge environment.

    This environment is used to train autonomous vehicles to attenuate the
    formation and propagation of waves in an open merge network.

    Required from env_params:

    * max_accel: maximum acceleration for autonomous vehicles, in m/s^2
    * max_decel: maximum deceleration for autonomous vehicles, in m/s^2
    * target_velocity: desired velocity for all vehicles in the network, in m/s
    * num_rl: maximum number of controllable vehicles in the network

    States
        The observation consists of the speeds and bumper-to-bumper headways of
        the vehicles immediately preceding and following autonomous vehicle, as
        well as the ego speed of the autonomous vehicles.

        In order to maintain a fixed observation size, when the number of AVs
        in the network is less than "num_rl", the extra entries are filled in
        with zeros. Conversely, if the number of autonomous vehicles is greater
        than "num_rl", the observations from the additional vehicles are not
        included in the state space.

    Actions
        The action space consists of a vector of bounded accelerations for each
        autonomous vehicle $i$. In order to ensure safety, these actions are
        bounded by failsafes provided by the simulator at every time step.

        In order to account for variability in the number of autonomous
        vehicles, if n_AV < "num_rl" the additional actions provided by the
        agent are not assigned to any vehicle. Moreover, if n_AV > "num_rl",
        the additional vehicles are not provided with actions from the learning
        agent, and instead act as human-driven vehicles as well.

    Rewards
        The reward function encourages proximity of the system-level velocity
        to a desired velocity, while slightly penalizing small time headways
        among autonomous vehicles.

    Termination
        A rollout is terminated if the time horizon is reached or if two
        vehicles collide into one another.
